*NETWORKING FOR HACKERS!*
       Introduction to Networking
● A computer network consists of two or more computing devices connected to each other to share resources and information. 
● The network becomes a powerful tool when computers communicate and share resources with other computers on the same network or entirely distinct networks.
● Computers on a network can acts as a *CLIENT* or a *SERVER*
Client computer : A client is a computer that requests for resources. 
Server computer :A server is a computer that controls and provides access to resources. But have higher RAM,CPU and STORAGE
   Local area network (LAN) : A LAN covers a relatively small area such as a classroom, school, or a single building
   Metropolitan area network (MAN) :A MAN spans the distance of a typical metropolitan city. 
   -The cost of installation and operation is higher
   Wide area network (WAN) :WANs span a larger area than a single city.The Internet is a good example of a WAN
         Peer-to-peer 
● In a peer-to-peer network, all computers are considered equal. 
● Each computer controls its own information and is capable of functioning as either a client or a server depending upon the requirement. 
● Peer-to-peer networks are cheap and easy to install.
● They are popular as home networks and for use in small companies. 
● Most operating systems come with built-in peer-to-peer networking capability.
● The maximum number of peers that can operate on a peer-to-peer network is ten. 
● Each peer shares resources and allows others open access to them
           Server based 
● A server-based network offers centralized control and is designed for secure operations. 
● In a server-based network, a dedicated server controls the network.
          Client-based 
● Client-based network servers process requests from clients and return just the results.
● These networks take advantage of the powerful processing capabilities of both the client and the server
-IP (Internet Protocol) is a Network Layer Protocol.
USAGE of IP’s : Used to connect to another computer or network. , Allows transfers of files and e-mail , Identify a device.
         IP types : ○ IPv4 ○ IPv6
IPv4 ( Internet protocol version 4): is a 32-bit sequence of 1s and 0s. 
● To make the IP address easier to use, the address is usually written as four decimal numbers separated by periods. 
● IP generated by DHCP or Manually
● Each section is 8 bits long 
● Each section can range from 0 to 25.
-Every IP address has two parts: 
     ○ Network: to identify the network( home) 
     ○ Host: identify the user(phone,PC)
● The first(1) host address is called GATEWAY ADDRESS.
 ● Any HOST have 2 different IP’s 
 ● Public IP: is an ip address that is given to the host on the WAN network 
 ● Private IP: is ip that is given to the host on LAN network. (intranet)
➔ There are 5 classes of private IP address A B C D and E ➔ CLASS A: Governments :have 24bit of space for HOSTS
➔ CLASS B: medium Companies :have 16bit of space for HOSTS
➔ CLASS C: small companies:have 8bit of space for HOSTS and 24-bit of network(home office school)
➔ CLASS D: MultiCasting(streaming) 
➔ CLASS E: Future Use (IETF research)
Reserved IP Addresses:Certain host addresses are reserved and cannot be assigned to devices on a network
          a. Addresses beginning 127 are reserved for loopback and internal testing 
          b. An IP address that has binary 0s in all host bit positions is reserved for the network address. 
          c. An IP address that has binary 1 or 255s in all host bit positions is reserved for the broadcast address
IPv6 ( Internet Protocol Version 6):is a 128-bit alphanumeric long value that identifies an endpoint devices in IPv6 network. 
■ ALPHANumeric ■ Separated by colon(:) ■ IP generated automatically. 
● The main difference is the IP-space(host holding) IPv4 holds 32-bit ip address but IPv6 holds 128-bit ip Addresses
 to know ip of  computers  : 
 command on window :"ipconfig"
on linux : "ifconfig"
  MAC(Media Access Control) Address :Flat name space of 48 bits Typically written in six octets in hex 
   E.g., 00-15-C5-49-04-A9
OSI(Open Systems Interconnection) Reference model :
● It is an idea model to show the way of network work 
● Model has 7 layers. 
● It shows How Data transfers between 2 hosts/servers
● Layers 1-4 relate to communications technology. 
● Layers 5-7 relate to user applications. 
● The sequence differ when sender and receiver use it
Layer 7: Application Layer :Level at which applications access network services.  Represents  software applications for file transfers, database access, and electronic mail, BROWSERS etc. 
● Your data is DATA 
○ PROTOCOLS: HTTP,FTP,SMTP
Layer 6: Presentation Layer :Providing services for secure efficient data transmission 
e.g. data encryption, and data compression. 
● Your data is DATA 
  ○PROTOCOLS: SSL
  Layer 5: Session Layer : Allows two applications on different computers to establish, use, and end a session.  e.g. file transfer, remote login
Layer 4: Transport Layer : Repackages long messages when necessary into small packets for transmission [ sender ] .Reassembles packets in correct order to get the original message. [ receiver ]
● Your data is SEGMENTS
● PROTOCOLS: TCP,UDP
Layer 3: Network Layer: Determines the route from the source to the destination computer 
○ Manages traffic problems, such as switching, routing, and controlling the congestion of data packets. 
● Your data is PACKETS 
● PROTOCOLS: ICMP,ARP,NAT,IP
Layer 2: Data Link Layer: Provides reliable transmission of frames
● Your data is FRAMES 
● PROTOCOLS: PPP,NDP,CDP
Layer 1: Physical Layer :Transmits bits from one computer to another .Regulates the transmission of a stream of bits over a physical medium.
● Your data is Bits 
● PROTOCOLS/DEVICES: RS-449
    TCP :Reliable ,Connection-Oriented protocol Means it establishes a connection between the receiver and sender. 
    ■ It uses 3 way HandShake ( more on Network Hacking ) . Used on emails, Chat,watching online videos, simple browsing ,have 5 model
	 Application,Presentation and session layers are combined together and called APPLICATION
     UDP(User Datagram Protocol)
    Connectionless ,less reliable, but faster and more straightforward. ●
     It’s often used in situations where higher speeds are crucial, like in streaming or gaming
           Firewall 
    ● A firewall is a network security device that monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic and decides whether to allow or block specific traffic based on a defined set of security rules. 
    ● It is Just A collection of rules to allow and deny network traffics
